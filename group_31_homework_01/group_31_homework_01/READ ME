Project : A sample multi-chat server and client application where messages are based on the SBCP(Simple Broadcast Chat Protocol).
Team Number : 31
Team Members : Anshika Mehndiratta, Balakumar Jayaraman

The basic functionality of the application is :
1. Start the server on a particular port, with which multiple clients can connect and chat.
2. Message sent by one client is broadcasted to all other clients
3. When a client leaves the chat, server is notified of the same, and it broadcasts it to other clients.
4. Also, when a client joins, it is notified (ACK or NAK) of its connection to the server.

It consists of 3 source files :

1. ServerForSBCP.c
2. ClientForSBCP.c
3. StructForSBCP.h

and a Makefile.

1) ServerForSBCP.c : This is the main server file, where server is started and server accepts multiple client connections with JOIN messages. On receiving a   			     client connection, the server validates the user and accordingly sends an ACK Message if validation is succesful, and NAK if validation is 		     unsuccesful. Further, when server receives a message from a client, it broadcasts the same to all other clients.

2) ClientForSBCP.c : Connects to the server and contains functions for sending the join message, getting and interpreting server messages and taking user input   			     for chatting with clients.

3) StructForSBCP.h : Contains the structures such as HeaderSBCP, AttributeSBCP and MessageSBCP for representing the SBCP message format. 

How to run this application :

1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open the terminal from the folder.
3. Run the following command : make -f Makefile
4. From a terminal, run : ./Server <IP-address> <port no.> <maxConnections>
5. From multiple terminals, run : ./Client <username> <Server-IP-address> <port no.>
